                                    While there are countless job boards such as Glassdoor, Handshake, Indeed, etc. there are no platforms designed solely for students to share their ideas and projects. Existing job boards and job sites often tend to feel too formal and don’t give a space for emerging ideas, projects, and startups. Thus, for many students, it is 
                                    difficult to find like-minded people with diverse skill sets to build and organize a project team. A relevant information technology problem is that these job boards and job sites are too formal, and are full of posting for established companies. Even the, the platform is only meant for use up to the point of hiring (not after). This means the application 
                                    scope is too limited, requiring the use of external chat softwares after initial introduction. In addition, finding a job, internship, or opportunity can be very difficult and frustrating because of the competitive nature, companies ghosting applicants, the rather callous nature of job hunting, and trying to tailor your passions 
                                    to fit into a particular position you’re applying for. Existing job sites feel one-dimensional and are only used to connect established companies/organizations with applicants.

                                    <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> and <a href="https://www.startuptree.co/students/">UW StartupTree</a> are two sites that currently allow users to connect specifically with emerging companies and startups, however their interfaces can be confusing and their limited scope leads to less usage. There are no immediate examples of platforms that allow students to connect with other students, leaving a gap in the market.

                                <p><em>Campus Cloud is designed primarily for students.</em></p>
                                <p>
                                    With Campus Cloud, ambitious students with diverse skill sets can connect over an exciting idea. For example, maybe you’re a computer science major that wants to build a website but don’t know how to create an aesthetic UI. Or maybe you’re a design student with an idea but don’t know how to implement the most technical engineering aspects. Or maybe you’re an aspiring chef that wants to share your food with others. Campus Cloud is meant to give these aspiring students a place to find zealous peers across campus or nearby colleges as well. Many students may feel as if they are not getting opportunities or internships from established corporations because of a lack of experience or any number of factors. This app is built for students to pave their own way and create their own opportunities.

                                    Within the web app, users will be able to: 
                                </p>

                                        <li>Create a profile to display basic information such as their name, year in school, college, and major</li>

                                            <li>Display their skills on their profile with tags</li>

                                        <li>To get their ideas out there, users will be able to post their projects with a description, desired skills/positions, goals, size of the project, etc.</li> 
                                        <li>To “apply” to projects, to get rid of the formal nature of job boards, students will be able to message the user(s) part of the project.</li> 
                                        <li>To foster a community of collaboration, within each project, there will be discussion board posts for people to suggest ideas or comment what they think about the project, offering a low commitment avenue of interaction between users.</li> 
                                        <li>For convenience, users will also be able to save interesting projects and search for projects based on location/campus.</li>

                                    <p>
                                        Most of the data that will be viewed will be user generated information. As mentioned above, users will be able to input their personal and professional information. In addition, information about the projects will be data that will be stored for reference whenever necessary. So things such as names, user names, birthdays, majors, colleges, and skill tags will be stored. Project name/id, description, and group members will also be stored in a database.

                                    As college students, there is much emphasis put on finding a well-paying job or internship at a big corporation. This is reflected by the sheer number of job boards and job finding websites that exist. There are even various websites for students trying to find opportunities at startups. But what about giving students the 
                                    opportunity to explore their own ideas and projects? Campus Cloud takes away from the stress of trying to apply to X number of jobs with the most perfect resume and cover letter. Instead, students are allowed to connect and contribute however much they feel. In addition, some sites, like Glassdoor and Hankshake, feel as if they 
                                    are only meant for applying to jobs and other sites, like LinkedIn, have greater focus on networking and not so much applying to actual positions. Our web app strives to have a balance of finding potential projects to work on with other students while also serving as a place to network.
