                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While there are countless job boards such as Glassdoor, Handshake, Indeed, etc., there are no platforms designed solely for students to share their ideas and projects. Existing job boards and job sites tend to feel too formal and don’t give a space for emerging ideas, projects, and startups. Thus, for many students, it is 
                                    difficult to find like-minded people with diverse skill sets to build and organize a project team. A relevant information technology problem is that these job boards and job sites are too formal, and are full of postings for established companies. Additionally the platform is only meant for use up to the point of hiring, not after. This means the application 
                                    scope is too limited, requiring the use of external chat software after the initial introduction. In addition, finding a job, internship, or opportunity can be very difficult and frustrating because of the competitive and callous nature of job hunting, companies ghosting applicants, and trying to tailor your passions 
                                    to fit into a particular position you’re applying for. Existing job sites feel one-dimensional and are only used to connect established companies/organizations with applicants.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> and <a href="https://www.startuptree.co/students/">UW StartupTree</a> are two sites that currently allow users to connect specifically with emerging companies and startups, however, their interfaces can be confusing, and their limited scope leads to less usage. There are no immediate examples of platforms that allow students to connect with other students, leaving a gap in the market.

                                <p><em>Campus Cloud is designed primarily for students.</em></p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With Campus Cloud, ambitious students with diverse skill sets can connect over an exciting idea. For example, consider a computer science student who wants to build a website but doesn’t know how to create an aesthetic UI and a design student with an idea but a lack of experience implementing the technical engineering aspects. These two students have complementary skills but are missing a path to one another. Campus Cloud will provide these innovative students a place to find zealous peers across their campus and nearby colleges. Many students may feel that they are not getting opportunities or internships from established corporations because of a lack of experience, impersonal job searching, and several other factors. This app is built for students to pave their own way and create their own opportunities.

                                <p>
                                    Within the web app, users will be able to: 
                                </p>

                                        <li>Create a profile to display basic information such as their name, year in school, college, and major</li>

                                            <li>Display their skills on their profile with tags</li>
                                            <li>Display their resume for others to see</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        <li>To get their ideas out there, users will be able to post their projects with a description, desired skills/positions, goals, size of the project, etc.</li> 
                                        <li>To “apply” to projects, to get rid of the formal nature of job boards, students will be able to message the user(s) part of the project.</li> 
                                        <li>To foster a community of collaboration, within each project, there will be discussion board posts for people to suggest ideas or comment on what they think about the project, offering a low-commitment avenue of interaction between users.</li> 
                                        <li>For convenience, users will be able to save interesting projects and search for projects based on location/campus.</li>

                                    <p>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Most of the viewable data will be user-generated information. As mentioned above, users will be able to input their personal and professional information. In addition, information about the projects will be data that will be stored for reference whenever necessary. So things such as names, user names, birthdays, majors, colleges, and skill tags will be stored. Project name/ID, description, and group members will also be stored in a database. 
                                    </p>

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As college students, there is an overwhelming emphasis on finding a well-paying job or internship at a big corporation. This is reflected by the sheer number of job boards and job-finding websites that exist. There are even various websites for students trying to find opportunities at startups. But what about allowing students the 
                                    opportunity to explore their own ideas and projects? Campus Cloud reduces the stress of applying to a seemingly unlimited number of jobs with a perfect resume and cover letter each time. Instead, students are allowed to connect and contribute however much they feel. In addition, some sites, like Glassdoor and Hankshake, feel as though they 
                                    are solely for applying to jobs, and other sites, like LinkedIn, focus more on networking and not so much on applying to actual positions. Our web app strives to balance finding potential projects to work on with other students while also serving as a place to network.
