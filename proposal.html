                                <p>
                                    &nbsp &nbsp Your proposal will contain a short description of the topic domain and the information/data you'll be presenting, explaining the problem to someone who doesn't know anything about it! Your description should include enough information to:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").

                                    </li>
                                    <li> 
                                        Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")

                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp &nbsp In short: let us know what you are interested in, and identify a problem that you think needs solving (and that might be amenable to a technological intervention) while also considering what has come before.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp &nbsp This description should be 1-2 paragraphs (~150-250 words) in length. Your overview should explain "what" the problem is and "why" it needs addressing (including why any currently existing apps are insufficient). You will need to include references to other resources to help clarify your explanation of this problem.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While there are countless job boards such as Glassdoor, Handshake, Indeed, etc. there are no platforms designed solely for students to share their ideas and projects. Existing job boards and job sites often tend to feel too formal and don’t give a space for emerging ideas, projects, and startups. Thus, for many students, it is 
                                    difficult to find like-minded people with diverse skill sets to build and organize a project team. A relevant information technology problem is that some of these job boards and job sites are too formal, of established companies, have bad UI, use up to the point of hiring (not after), etc. It is also the case that the application 
                                    scope is too limited, requiring the use of external chat softwares after initial introduction. In addition, finding a job, internship, or opportunity can be very difficult and frustrating because of the competitive nature, companies ghosting applicants, the rather callous nature of job hunting, and trying to tailor your passions 
                                    to fit into a particular position you’re applying for. There are many existing job sites and job boards such as Handshake, Glassdoor, and Indeed. However, like mentioned above, these can often feel one-dimensional (only used for applying and nothing) and are only used to connect established companies/organizations with applicants.
                                     Y Combinator and UW StartupTree are two examples of job sites that allow users to connect with emerging companies and startups, however the UI is not the most intuitive and it just feels like any other job site, just on a smaller scale. There are no immediate examples of platforms that allow students to connect with other students. 
                                     
                                     Existing attempts - examples such as Handshake, Glassdoor, Indeed, Y Combinator, UW StartupTree etc.

                                <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp &nbsp Your proposal will also contain a description of the web app that you will create to help address your chosen problem (a proposed "solution"). Think about what kind of a web app would help with this problem, and how people would use that app to make their lives better in some way. What is the "use case" or "user story" for the app?
                                </p>
                                <ul> 
                                    <li> 
                                        Remember that this app will be interactive—it will need to contain buttons, forms, etc that let the user provide some kind of input and modify how data is presented to them. Thus your app will need to do more than just be something for the user to read; it needs to give the user something to <em>do</em>.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp &nbsp Your app should also be described in <em>2-3 paragraphs</em>. In particular, you should make sure to address:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
                                    </li>
                                    <li> 
                                        What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! Remember: 
                                    </li> 
                                        <ul> <li> 
                                            Remember that "viewing" information or navigating ("going to") to something isn't a feature! 
                                        </li></ul>
                                    <li> 
                                        What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
                                    </li>
                                        <ul> <li> 
                                            If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/ . If you can't get data back from this testing site, then it won't work with your project.
                                        </li></ul>
                                    <li>
                                        How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
                                    </li>
                                        <ul><li> 
                                            Remember the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
                                        </li></ul>
                                </ol>

                                    For our initial project proposal, Campus Cloud is designed primarily for students: our application is meant to connect students with ambitious ideas and diverse skill sets. For example, maybe you’re a computer science major that wants to build a website but don’t know how to create an aesthetic UI. Or maybe you’re a design student 
                                    with an idea but don’t know how to implement the most technical engineering aspects. Or maybe you’re an aspiring chef that wants to share your food with others. Cloud Campus is meant to give these aspiring students a place to find zealous peers across campus or nearby colleges as well. Many students may feel as if they are not 
                                    getting opportunities or internships from established corporations because of a lack of experience or any number of factors. This app is built for students to pave their own way and create their own opportunities.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Within the web app, users will be able to create a profile to display basic information such as their name, year in school, college, and major. In addition, users will also be able to display their skills on their profile with tags and even display their resume for others to see. To get their ideas out there, users will be able 
                                    to post their projects with a description, desired skills/positions, goals, size of the project, etc. To “apply” to projects, to get rid of the formal nature of job boards, students will be able to message the user(s) part of the project. To foster a community of collaboration, within each project, there will be discussion board
                                     posts for people to suggest ideas or comment what they think about the project, offering a low commitment avenue of interaction between users. For convenience, users will also be able to save interesting projects and search for projects based on location/campus. Most of the data that will be viewed will be user generated 
                                     information. As mentioned above, users will be able to input their personal and professional information. In addition, information about the projects will be data that will be stored for reference whenever necessary. So things such as names, user names, birthdays, majors, colleges, and skill tags will be stored. Project name/id
                                     , description, and group members will also be stored in a database. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As college students, there is much emphasis put on finding a well-paying job or internship at a big corporation. This is reflected by the sheer number of job boards and job finding websites that exist. There are even various websites for students trying to find opportunities at startups. But what about giving students the 
                                    opportunity to explore their own ideas and projects? Campus Cloud takes away from the stress of trying to apply to X number of jobs with the most perfect resume and cover letter. Instead, students are allowed to connect and contribute however much they feel. In addition, some sites, like Glassdoor and Hankshake, feel as if they 
                                    are only meant for applying to jobs and other sites, like LinkedIn, have greater focus on networking and not so much applying to actual positions. Our web app strives to have a balance of finding potential projects to work on with other students while also serving as a place to network.

                                    &nbsp &nbsp You should present the above information (Problem Description and App Description) in the form of a basic web page implemented with HTML and CSS. Create a new proposal.html file in the root of your project repo. This web page should include the following content:

                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        An appropriate page structure (including a <em>head</em> element with a <em>title</em>). The basic web page template is a good place to start.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        A <em>header</em> containing a title for your page as a top-level heading (<em>h1</em>).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Different <em>section</em> elements for each major part of your page (e.g., Problem Description, Proposed Application). Note that a functionality walkthrough would be appropriate as a "subsection" (e.g., a <em>section</em> within a <em>section</em>).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Use appropriate HTML elements to semantically organize the content. For example, you might describe the different interactions a user can perform using an unordered list.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Include hyperlinks to at least two (2) outside resources, references, or data sets related to your topic. These can be links to other applications in the same problem space. If you'll be using an existing data set, be sure to link to that!
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        You will need to include some CSS styling. Create a new css folder inside of your repo, and a new proposal.css file inside of that folder. The styling can be whatever you want (change the font, background, etc), but you should include at least two (2) rules that change at least three (3) different properties total.
                                    </li>
                                        <ul><li>
                                            Adding some spacing around the content is a great use of CSS.
                                        </li></ul>
